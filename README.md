Shukuchi is an Obsidian plugin that enables you to teleport to links (URL or internal link) and jump to their destinations.

It essentially operates like the 'Follow link under cursor' command. The only difference is that even if there is no link under the cursor, it can close the distance to a nearby link and then navigate to its destination.

The priority of choosing a link is as follows.

1. Moves to the nearest link on the same line (depends on options).
2. If no link is on the same line, it moves to the link closest to the cursor.
